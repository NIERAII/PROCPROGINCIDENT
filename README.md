# PROCPROGINCIDENT
**I H8 WORKING**  

This repo is basically my procedural programming ~~home~~work  
Also, those are just bare files, without the project itself, so yeah, deal with it.
  
**Feel free to steal it**  
```But at least change smth a lil bit```
## HW C++
**IFELSEINCIDENT.cpp** - is where you can find first 3 hws  
*Oh, btw, it was made entierly of "if else" because who the hell are voids, im cosplaying yanderedev lMAO.*
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
**That all for now**
